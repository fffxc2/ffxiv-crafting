designed to mirror crafting in the game Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn
Useful for trying out different crafting logic

Make a function similar to chainCraft, simpCraft and quickHQ that contains all crafting logic
then pass it to avg to get an idea for how much quality you can gain

Also, many crafting functions are non-existant, implement more as needed
